# Inky Helpful Things
A repository for useful things that I came up with or gathered for my Inky stories.

Currently holds:

A CSS file where I have compiled a few useful and good looking styles for my stories.

Two Inky files with unicode emoji hardcoded as constants so they can easily be deploeyed in the story without bugging out the editor itself.

	-Internet version is an updated version
	-Selfmade version has been collected and categorized; but less complete then internet (probably)
 	-Healthbar function that relies on the former mentioned emote files to display a healthbar
